üëã Hi, We are @acxtron

At Acxtron, we are an insights and productivity company with a strong focus on helping business leaders reduce decision fatigue and save time, by helping them visualize data using insightful dashboards and make more informed decisions faster.

We believe that leveraging on data using Power BI can greatly impact companies as it improves productivity and makes the organisation a lot more agile as they can have access to the data they need anytime, anywhere.

With over 4 years of experience with business analytics projects, across retail, construction, F&B, procurement, fleeting management, customer service, finance, HR and other functions, we can provide you new insights into the way you can work with your data.

Regardless of scale, whether across entire organisation to different subsidiaries located in different countries, we strive to leverage on our experience to deliver the best possible solutions through the spectrum of consultancy service, proof-of-concept development to full-scale implementation service. We can also work with other applications within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem such as SharePoint, Power Automate and Power Apps.

We have a deep passion for understanding your challenges and implementing a solution that is right for you.

Work with us today to make a difference in your business.
